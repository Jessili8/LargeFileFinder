## Technical Details

### **Architecture**
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 9.0)
- **Language**: C# with modern language features
- **UI Pattern**: MVVM-like with ObservableCollection
- **File Operations**: Native .NET File I/O + VB.NET FileSystem for recycle bin

### **Key Components**
- **MainWindow.xaml**: UI layout and controls
- **MainWindow.xaml.cs**: Application logic and event handlers
- **FileDetail**: Data model for file information
- **SafeEnumerateFiles**: Recursive directory scanning with error handling

### **Safety Mechanisms**
- **Permission handling**: Gracefully skips inaccessible directories
- **Error isolation**: Individual file operation errors don't stop the process
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Prevent accidental data loss
- **Status feedback**: Real-time operation status and results

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**"Access Denied" errors**
- Normal behavior for system directories
- Application automatically skips inaccessible folders
- Run as administrator for broader access (if needed)

**Large scan taking too long**
- Scanning entire drives (especially C:) can take time
- Consider scanning specific folders instead
- Check status bar for progress updates

**Files not appearing in results**
- Verify the minimum size threshold
- Check the selected size unit (MB/GB/TB)
- Ensure the search path is correct

**Cannot delete some files**
- Files may be in use by other applications
- Some system files are protected
- Check individual error messages for details
